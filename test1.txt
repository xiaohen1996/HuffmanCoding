On the eighty fifth day of his unlucky streak, 
Santiago takes his skiff into the Gulf Stream, 
sets his lines and by noon, has his bait taken by a big fish 
that he is sure is a marlin. Unable to haul in the great marlin, 
Santiago is instead pulled by the marlin, 
and two days and nights pass with Santiago holding onto the line. 
Though wounded by the struggle and in pain, 
Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, 
often referring to him as a brother. 
He also determines that, because of the fish's great dignity, 
no one shall deserve to eat the marlin.
On the third day, the fish begins to circle the skiff.
